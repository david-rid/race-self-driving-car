# race-self-driving-car
A library-free Neural Network in JavaScript to simulate autonomous vehicle navigation within a custom-built racing environment. Implemented with real-time sensor logic and spatial-data processing to enable a self-learning AI agent to compete against human players in a low-latency racing simulation.
